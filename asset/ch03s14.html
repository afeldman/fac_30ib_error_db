This is normally the result of an operation time out. The auto calibration can abort for several reasons. The function of this alarm is as follows. First, the Auto Calibration Aborted alarm will post if an error has occurred. The next alarm will contain the cause of the auto calibration to abort. Cause 1: While searching for the minimum or maximum flow rates in the cal table, the calibration timed-out by reaching the maximum number of attempts to establish the minimum      or maximum flow rate output   values. This can be a result ofimproper fluid restriction   selection, non-attainable cal  table flow ranges, or a bad fluid  regulator. The resulting alarmswould be PAIN-251, Failed to find      upper limit or PAIN-252, Failed to find lower limit.         Remedy 1: Increase the number of Maximum      Calibration Trys in the AccuStatsetup. Verify restrictor,   regulator and calibration flow rate range in the AccuStat ColorData for that valve.         Cause 2: Calibration resulted in non- increasing command values in thecalibration table data. The  slope of the calibration table is      negative. Increasing output  values do not result in increased      flow rate. The result error codewill be PAIN-254 Non-increasing cal table.              Remedy 2: Verify all equipment is   operating properly. Check the linear potentiometer feedback  (AIN[1, DISP]), the regulator  operation, and that trigger is opening and closing properly.  Verify attainable values have  been set in the AccuStat Color Data for the requested minimum and maximum flow rates.       Cause 3: The calibration routine   calculated output values that are      above or below the maximum or  minimum output values defined inthe Applicator Parameters for the fluid regulator. The minimum      output values in counts are (low-res: 200, hi-res: 1600) and the maximum output values in counts are (low-res: 1000, and hi-res: 8000). The restrictor size is not      compatible with the desired flowrate range and the material   attempting to be calibrated. The      resulting error codes will be  PAIN-255 Calculated output &gt; maxoutput or PAIN-256 Calculated  output &lt; min output.         Remedy 3: Verify that the fluid    regulator is functioning    properly. Change the fluid   restrictor size to better    accommodate the requested flow rate range. Change the requested      flow rate range in the AccuStat Color Data setup.          Cause 4: The calibration has been   aborted by the user or has been interrupted by another fault. If      the cell has been emergency   stopped during the calibration. The robot failed to reach the  proper location in order to   calibrate. See other alarms to determine the cause of the fault.  Remedy 4: Determine the cause of the  fault to the robot. Check the alarm log to aid finding the  cause of the fault.

Remedy : Verify proper TPR was    calculated. Verify the fill is completing successfully. Check for other alarms that occurred during this job. Make sure all equipment is operating properly,such as the trigger or regulator.      Check can empty timeout value  (default = 1500 ms). Perform  Auto Calibration on that color if      all parts are operating properly.

The    potentiometer is not operating properly. The trigger delay maynot be set properly, if trigger events are too close together.    Remedy : Check regulator operation andAdaptive Gain settings in the  AccuStat Color Data for that  color valve. Verify the triggerdelays are setup properly.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> N/A</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PAIN-260 WARN TPR exceeds Can Volume </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b>  The calculated TPR is more than the can has volume for. The TPRfor that job is too large. If the TPR for a job normally   approaches the limit of the sizeof the canister, then the    adaptive fill tolerance may   attempt to add additional paint beyond the limit of the canistervolume.               Remedy : Setup for a re-dock. Decreasethe Adaptive Fill Gain parameterin the AccuStat setup screen.  Reduce the size of the job if itis larger than 1550 ccs. This is      the maximum volume of the    AccuStat canister.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> N/A</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PAIN-261 WARN Canister Fill Error </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b>  Prior to painting the job, the can is checked to see if enough paint has been put into the can (cylinder position counts &gt;= TPRcounts). This can happen if thewaiting for can full condition is      falsely satisfied. Possible  causes are air in the canister due to faulty color change cycles      or unstable readings from the  linear potentiometer. Many times      this happens because the air hasnot been pushed out of the dump before the fill valve is opened.   Remedy : Make sure that paint has   reached the docking station   before starting the step to openthe fill valve. A fix could be increasing the amount of time ofthe step to fill the paint line before opening the fill valve. With air in the can, once the  piston pressure has been    reapplied the air will compress causing the cylinder position tofall below the fill counts.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> N/A</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PAIN-262 WARN Auto Calibration Successful </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b>  The Color Valve selected for  Auto Calibration has successfully      completed the calibration    sequence.

This can be caused by low flow rates, where it takes longer to see this minimum cylinder    position change. Could be an  indicator of trouble with the  linear potentiometer or the   feedback circuit.          Remedy : Lower the Minimum Canister  Change Counts or increase the  Canister Check Time. Check the feedback from the linear    potentiometer or repair the low voltage wire for the canister  feedback circuit.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> N/A</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PAIN-264 WARN Canister Position Increasing </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b>  This is caused by the piston  moving during a color change when      the piston is held at the bottomof the can for cleaning. In theevent that the cleaning solvent and air pressure, overcome the piston air pressure, then this alarm will occur.          Remedy : Perform a scale calibration toinsure that the calculated valuefor the Can Empty Check Counts is      valid. Increase the Fill Error Tolerance. Verify that the   piston pressure is not being  restricted.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> N/A</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PAIN-265 WARN Intermittent Connection Detected </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b>  A reading of 0 counts on the  analog inpit (AIN[1,DISP]) causes      the alarm, intermittent     connection. This is an indicator      of potentiometer trouble during job playback, caused by an   open/short circuit in cylinder position feedback. This alarm only occurs during a job or color      change in auto mode.      Regular, but not consistent   postings of this alarm indicatesa poor electrical connection in the feedback circuit. The   electrical connector at the QD plate, when damaged or worn can cause this alarm. Induced noisein the feedback circuit from poor      grounding leads to this temporary      condition as well. Resistors  inside the robot controller set the supply voltage to the linearpotentiometer and it should be 10      Volts.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Replace the electrical     connector on the QD plate.   Verify proper grounding of the feedback            circuit. Replace the low voltage      cable in the robot arm. Check the supply voltage to the linearpotentiometer.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PAIN-266 WARN Flow Error High, Valve: %s </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b>  If the percentage of paint left in the can exceeds the TPR by the      Job Total Error Tolerance, then this alarm will post. If the  paint usage exceeds the TPR by the Job Total Error Tolerance, then also this alarm will post. Most of the time, the can will run out of paint before the paint      usage exceeds the TPR by this  percentage. This indicates thatthe fluid flow has been     restricted or the can has run out      of paint.              Remedy : The paint needs to be     calibrated or the adaptive gain for that color valve is too high.      The regulator may not be    actuating properly from not   running a clean out cycle beforethe end             of the shift. Often other errorconditions will occur prior to this alarm.

It is not likely that the set point will be reached within the specified tolerances. This may be caused by the use  of a flow rate setpoint that is below the value that the  air system can accurately provide.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> In some way decrease the yield. Use larger  diameter air lines to supply air to the cap. Use a smaller ratio booster. Otherwise accept a larger tolerance band.

This can be caused by: air leaks, a loose air cap or a significant increase of air supply pressure Note that the system continues to close the loop and  generally maintain requested flow rates even after this  alarm if there are no other alarms occurring. This alarm can provide early warning of the possible failures. This alarm is controlled by the Adaptive tolerance parameter.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Check that the air cap is tight on the gun. Check, clean and possibly replace the air cap. Check for leaks in air lines or at fittings. Check for cracks or breaks in the gun. Check for a large increase of air supply pressure.

This is normally the result of an operation time-out. The auto calibration can abort for several reasons. The function of this alarm is as follows: First, the Auto Calibration Aborted alarm will post if an error has occurred. The next alarm will contain the cause of the auto calibration to abort.  <b>Cause 1:</b> While searching for the minimum or maximum flow rates in the calibration table, the calibration timed out by reaching the maximum number of attempts to establish the minimum or maximum flow rate output values. This can be a result of improper fluid restriction selection, non-attainable calibration table flow ranges, or a bad fluid regulator. The resulting alarms would be PNT1-251, Failed to find upper limit or PNT1-252, Failed to find lower limit.  <b>Cause 2:</b> Calibration resulted in non-increasing command values in the calibration table data. The slope of the calibration table is negative. Increasing output values do not result in increased flow rate. The result error code will be PNT1-254 Non-increasing cal table.         <b>Cause 3:</b> The calibration routine calculated output values that are above or below the maximum or minimum output values defined in the Applicator Parameters for the fluid regulator. The minimum output values in counts are low-res: 200, hi-res: 1600, and the maximum output values in counts are low-res: 1000, and hi-res: 8000. The restrictor size is not compatible with the desired flow rate range and the material attempting to be calibrated. The resulting error codes will be PNT1-255 Calculated output &gt; max output or PNT1-256 Calculated output &lt; min output.  <b> Cause 4:</b> The calibration has been aborted by the user or has been interrupted by another fault such as an EMERGENCY STOP during calibration. Or, the robot failed to reach the proper location in order to calibrate. See other alarms to determine the cause of the fault. </p><p><b>Remedy:</b> <b>Remedy 1:</b> Increase the number of Maximum Calibration Trys in the AccuStat setup. Verify restrictor, regulator and calibration flow rate range in the AccuStat Color Data for that valve.  <b>Remedy 2:</b> Verify all equipment is operating properly. Check the linear potentiometer feedback (AIN[1, DISP], the regulator operation, and that the trigger is opening and closing properly. Verify attainable values have been set in the AccuStat Color Data for the requested minimum and maximum flow rates.   <b> Remedy 3:</b> Verify that the fluid regulator is functioning    properly. Change the fluid restrictor size to better accommodate the requested flow rate range.

Also, verify that the trigger delays are set up properly.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-179 WARN Canister Fill Error </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> Prior to painting the job, the can is checked to see if enough paint has been put into the can (cylinder position counts &gt;= TPR counts). This can occur if the "waiting for can full" condition is falsely satisfied. Possible causes are air in the canister due to faulty color change cycles, or unstable readings from the linear potentiometer. Many times this happens because the air has not been pushed out of the dump before the fill valve is opened.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Make sure that paint has reached the docking station before starting the step to open the fill valve. Try increasing the amount of time of the step to fill the paint line before opening the fill valve. With air in the can, after the piston pressure has been reapplied the air will compress causing the cylinder position to fall below the fill counts. </p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-180 WARN Auto Calibration Successful </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> The Color Valve selected for   Auto Calibration has successfully  completed the calibration   sequence.

This can be caused by low flow rates, where it takes longer to see this minimum cylinder position change. It could be an indicator of trouble with the linear potentiometer or the feedback circuit.    </p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Lower the Minimum Canister Change Counts or increase the Canister Check Time. Check the feedback from the linear potentiometer or repair the low voltage wire for the canister feedback circuit.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-182 WARN Canister Position Increasing </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> This alarm will be displayed if the piston moves during a color change cycle when it is held at the bottom of the can for cleaning, and the cleaning solvent and air pressure overcome the piston air pressure.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Perform a scale calibration to insure that the calculated value for the Can Empty Check Counts is valid. Increase the Fill Error Tolerance. Verify that the piston pressure is not being restricted.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-183 WARN Intermittent Connection Detected </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> A reading of 0 counts on the analog input (AIN[1,DISP]) causes the intermittent connection alarm. This is an indicator of potentiometer trouble during job playback, caused by an open/short circuit in cylinder position feedback. This alarm only occurs during a job or color change in auto mode. Regular, but not consistent, postings of this alarm indicate a poor electrical connection in the feedback circuit. The electrical connector at the quick disconnect (QD) plate, when damaged or worn, can cause this alarm. Induced noise in the feedback circuit from poor grounding leads to this temporary condition as well. Resistors inside the robot controller set the supply voltage to the linear potentiometer, and should be set at 10 Volts.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Replace the electrical connector on the quick disconnect (QD) plate. Verify proper grounding of the feedback circuit. Replace the low voltage cable in the robot arm. Check the supply voltage to the linear potentiometer.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-184 WARN Flow Error High, Valve: %s </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> If the percentage of paint left in the can exceeds the total paint required (TPR) by the Job Total Error Tolerance, then this alarm will post. If the paint usage exceeds the TPR by the Job Total Error Tolerance, then this alarm will be displayed. Most of the time, the can will run out of paint before the paint usage exceeds the TPR by this percentage. This indicates that the fluid flow has been restricted or the can has run out of paint.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> The paint needs to be calibrated or the adaptive gain for that color valve is too high. The regulator might not be actuating properly from not running a clean out cycle before the end of the shift. Often other error conditions will occur prior to this alarm. Check the alarm log to help detect other symptoms leading to this alarm.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-185 WARN Applicator Disabled during job </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> If the applicator is disabled at the end of the job, then the table will not adapt in hybrid mode.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> None.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-186 WARN Scale Calibration Aborted </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> The scale calibration sequence did not complete.

This might be caused by the use of a flow rate setpoint that is below the value that the air system can accurately provide. </p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Perform the following:  <div class='itemizedlist'><ul type='disc'><li><p>Decrease the yield.</p></li><li><p>Use larger diameter air lines to supply air to the cap. </p></li><li><p>Use a smaller ratio booster.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, accept a larger tolerance band.</p></li><li><p>Increase the minimum tolerance by about 50%.</p></li></ul></div> </p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-666 WARN %sCal. table adapted out, down </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> The relationship of the output command to the flow rate obtained has changed significantly since the last calibration. There is now a smaller output required to get the same flow rate. This can be caused by: air leaks, a loose air cap, or a significant increase of air supply pressure. Note that the system continues to close the loop and generally maintain requested flow rates even after this alarm if there are no other alarms occurring. This alarm can provide early warning of possible failures. This alarm is controlled by the Adaptive tolerance parameter.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Check that the air cap is tight on the gun. Check, clean, and possibly replace the air cap. Check for leaks in air lines or at fittings. Check for cracks or breaks in the gun. Check for a large increase of air supply pressure. Recalibrate to clear the alarm immediately. Increase the Adaptive tolerance parameter to allow larger changes without causing another alarm.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PNT1-667 WARN %sMax. flow is below midpt. output </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> During calibration it was found that the maximum amount of flow occurred with the command output at only the middle (midpoint) of the range.

This might also indicate a large air leak.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Check that the I/P transducer is within the correct right range. If not, replace it.

The most common causes of this are the following:  o Power to a remote I/O rack or Model-B I/O interface unit    is interrupted.  o The cable between the MAIN CPU PCB and the process I/O board,    racks, or Model-B interface units has been disconnected or is    faulty.  o Electrical interference between the I/O cables and other cables.    This can be eliminated by physically separating the I/O cables    from other wiring. In very electrically noisy environments, it    might be necessary to use optical isolators with these cables.</p><p><b>Remedy:</b> Check the cabling between theMAIN CPU PCB (JB-18 connector) and the process I/O board and/or model A or B interface modules. Check power to the remote Model A I/O racks and model B I/O interface modules. If corrections to these do not correct the problem, check the four numbers displayed in this error message. The first value must be interpreted bit-wise. If a bit is 1, the corresponding condition has been detected:   Bit 0: (CFER) A CRC or framing error has been detected by the       SLC-2 chip on the MAIN CPU PBC. This is most frequently       the result of the problems listed above. Otherwise, it might       indicate faulty SLC-2 chip, wiring between this and       the JB-1B connector on the main PCB, or faulty process       I/O, model-A I/O rack, or model-B interface unit.   Bit 1: (CALM) An error has been detected by a slave SLC-2 (process       I/O board, Model-A rack, or Model B interface unit).       More information is provided by the second number displayed       with the PRIO-020 error.   Bit 2: (CMER) A communication error has been detected by a slave       SLC-2. The potential causes are similar to those for       a CFER.   Bit 3: (IPRER): Internal parity error accessing SLC-2 internal       RAM. This indicates a faulty SLC-2 chip. In this case,       the third and fourth numbers displayed with the PRIO-020       error is the address and and data for which the error was       detected. This indicates a faulty SLC-2 chip.   Bit 4: (OPRER): Parity error accessing external RAM by the SLC-2       chip. This might indicate bad DRAM or CMOS memory on the       MAIN CPU PCB.   Bit 5: (ALMI): Indicates an alarm signalled from outside the SLC-2.       Check the controller Alarm Log for other errors reported.   Bit 6: (BSY): Auto scan is running. This might be either 0 or 1 and       does not indicate an error.   Bit 7: (CEND): Auto-scan cycle has completed. This might be either       0 or 1 and does not indicate an error.  The second number displayed is significant only if the CMER bit above is one.   Bits 0-4: Indicate the position in the I/O Link chain of the       slave unit in which error was detected. A value of 1       indicates the unit connected directly       to the I/O LINK connector.   Bit 5 (CFER): Indicates a CRC or framing error detected by the       slave SLC-2. The causes are similar to those for a CFER       error detected by the MAIN CPU SLC-2.   Bit 6 (ALMI): Indicates an error asserted outside the slave SLC-2.      This may indicate a problem with process I/O board, model-B      I/O rack, or model-B interface unit hardware.   Bit 7 (SYALM): Indicates a watchdog alarm or parity error detected      by the slave SLC-2. This may indicate a problem with the       process I/O board, model-A rack, or model-B interface      unit.</p></div><br><div class="pyton"><p><u><b>PRIO-021 SYST Unknown I/O hardware </b></u></p><p><b>Cause:</b> An unknown device is connected to the I/O Link connector.
