This is normally the result of an operation time out. The auto calibration can abort for several reasons. The function of this alarm is as follows. First, the Auto Calibration Aborted alarm will post if an error has occurred. The next alarm will contain the cause of the auto calibration to abort. Cause 1: While searching for the minimum or maximum flow rates in the cal table, the calibration timed-out by reaching the maximum number of attempts to establish the minimum      or maximum flow rate output   values. This can be a result ofimproper fluid restriction   selection, non-attainable cal  table flow ranges, or a bad fluid  regulator. The resulting alarmswould be PAIN-251, Failed to find      upper limit or PAIN-252, Failed to find lower limit.         Remedy 1: Increase the number of Maximum      Calibration Trys in the AccuStatsetup. Verify restrictor,   regulator and calibration flow rate range in the AccuStat ColorData for that valve.         Cause 2: Calibration resulted in non- increasing command values in thecalibration table data. The  slope of the calibration table is      negative. Increasing output  values do not result in increased      flow rate. The result error codewill be PAIN-254 Non-increasing cal table.              Remedy 2: Verify all equipment is   operating properly. Check the linear potentiometer feedback  (AIN[1, DISP]), the regulator  operation, and that trigger is opening and closing properly.  Verify attainable values have  been set in the AccuStat Color Data for the requested minimum and maximum flow rates.       Cause 3: The calibration routine   calculated output values that are      above or below the maximum or  minimum output values defined inthe Applicator Parameters for the fluid regulator. The minimum      output values in counts are (low-res: 200, hi-res: 1600) and the maximum output values in counts are (low-res: 1000, and hi-res: 8000). The restrictor size is not      compatible with the desired flowrate range and the material   attempting to be calibrated. The      resulting error codes will be  PAIN-255 Calculated output > maxoutput or PAIN-256 Calculated  output < min output.         Remedy 3: Verify that the fluid    regulator is functioning    properly. Change the fluid   restrictor size to better    accommodate the requested flow rate range. Change the requested      flow rate range in the AccuStat Color Data setup.          Cause 4: The calibration has been   aborted by the user or has been interrupted by another fault.

Cause 1: While searching for the minimum or maximum flow rates in the calibration table, the calibration timed out by reaching the maximum number of attempts to establish the minimum or maximum flow rate output values.
